By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period March 9 through April 5, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Govern- ment securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period March 9 through April 5, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed. With Messrs. Hayes and Kimbrel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until other- wise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services rose substan- tially in the first quarter primarily because of the resumption of higher automobile production, but that the unemployment rate remained high. More moderate growth in real GNP appears to be in prospect for the current quarter. Wage rates in most sectors are con- tinuing to rise at a rapid pace. The rate of advance in consumer prices and in wholesale prices of indus- trial commodities appears to have moderated recently. In March bank credit and the money stock both narrowly and broadly defined again expanded substantially, although the increases were less sharp than in February. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to banks and nonbank thrift institutions reached unusually high levels in the first quarter as interest rates on com- petitive short-term market instruments declined con- siderably further. In recent weeks, however, key short- term interest rates have moved up somewhat on balance. Yields on new issues of corporate and municipal bonds 4/6/71 -3- 4/6/71 -4- declined during much of March despite a continuing heavy calendar of offerings, but most recently long- term market yields have also risen somewhat. The over- all balance of payments deficit in the first quarter was exceptionally large. The trade surplus for the first two months was very small, and capital outflows have been stimulated by wide short-term interest rate differentials. Despite recent reductions in the dis- count rates of several European central banks, these differentials remain wide. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions con- ducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments. To implement this policy, while taking account of the Treasury financing the terms of which are to be announced late in the month, System open market opera- tions until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to attaining temporarily some minor firming in money market conditions, while con- tinuing to meet some part of reserve needs through purchases of coupon issues in the interest of promoting accommodative conditions in long-term credit markets; provided that money market conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from the growth paths desired. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 4, 1971, at 9:30 a.m. The meeting adjourned. Secretary
